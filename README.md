# Lightning receiving browser wallet
A browser wallet for bitcoin with built in support for receiving payments on the lightning network via submarine swaps (with help from a lightning service provider)

It's basically the same as [this project](https://github.com/supertestnet/vanilla-js-browser-wallet) except this wallet has a button for receiving coins on the lightning network.
